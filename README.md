Let's Get Spelunk!
A endless runner/flyer game that is set in a cave. The user("character") will be going on a spelunking adventure into a cave! 

The main goals for this project are too, build a game that is essentially endless. I will have one player that will be able to move around spike/rocks that are in it's way. I plan to use Javascript and html5 canvas.

User Stories - To play the game, the user will move the character up and down over the objects in the game. If the user hits and object they will die.
The user click starts and the level starts.

Added goals (above and beyond) include, adding more then one character so that the user can choose. Add a antagonist (cave goblin ...etc), have the brightness in the game decrease as your levels get higher.

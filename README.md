Let's Get Spelunk!
A endless runner/flyer game that is set in a cave. The user("character") will be going on a spelunking adventure into a cave! 

The main goals for this project are too, build a game that is essentially endless. I will have one player that will be able to move around spike/rocks that are in it's way. I plan to use Javascript and html5 canvas.

Added goals (above and beyond) include, adding more then one character so that the user can choose. Add a antagonist (cave goblin ...etc), have the brightness in the game decrease as your levels get higher.
